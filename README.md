# My Linux Configurations

This repository contains my Linux configurations,
primarily tailored for Arch(btw) Linux but compatible with other Distros.

## Requirements

For a faster and more efficient setup, `stow` is required.

### Arch Linux
Install `stow` using the following command:
```bash
sudo pacman -S stow
```

### Debian-Based Distributions
Install `stow` using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install stow
```

## Upcoming Improvements

I am currently working on an `install.sh` script that will automate the 
installation of all necessary packages and dependencies for a fresh OS installation.
